I am a results-driven software engineer with over five years of experience architecting and developing scalable web applications and high-traffic e-commerce platforms. My career is centered on leveraging a deep technical expertise in AI, machine learning, and full-stack development to build impactful, user-centered products.

My professional journey began at CitiusTech, where I developed a Patient Access System web app for Revenue Cycle Management, building modular and responsive user interfaces with Angular, TypeScript, and Material UI, supported by a robust backend using C# and .NET Core. This foundational experience in healthcare technology set the stage for my future roles. As a founding member at the startup AiNS PeopleTech, I took on the challenge of building a customer-facing mobile application from the ground up using Flutter and Dart. In this role, I designed and implemented recommendation algorithms that significantly increased user retention rates and built a scalable backend infrastructure using AWS Amplify and Git. Most recently, I served as a Senior Full Stack Developer at Peepul Tree, where I designed and deployed an end-to-end e-commerce platform capable of handling over 100,000 daily visitors. My work included creating an operations and analytics dashboard for real-time visibility into orders and user activity. By enhancing the shopping experience and checkout flow, I contributed to a fivefold boost in conversion rates. I also played a key role in optimizing backend systems with AWS for ultra-low latency and spearheaded the implementation of CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployments, while mentoring junior engineers in software best practices.

Currently, as a Software Research Engineer/Scientist at Intel, I am focused on developing an internal tool called PRISM UI to analyze weak points in chip design. My responsibilities include building a chip layer design heatmap using Leaflet and D3.js and modernizing a legacy Linux-based C++ application into a web-based visualization tool. I am also actively involved in code reviews and optimizing web applications for enhanced performance.

Academically, I hold a Master of Science in Information Technology from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where I graduated with a 9.63/10 GPA and specialized in NLP, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing. I also earned my B.Tech. in Electronics and Telecommunications from the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute. Throughout my career, I have been recognized for my work, including achieving state-of-the-art results with advanced recommender systems like IntentRec and RecKross. I also received "Excellent" recognition from a U.S.-based client for my work in Angular UI development and was awarded the National CCRT Scholarship for Visual Art & Painting.
